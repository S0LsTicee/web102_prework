## Notes

    Debugging the code as I'm implementing the main structures of the game cards was the most time consuming task for me as it is difficult to notice your own mistakes, especially typos or any misunderstanding of the new methods in the project. Correcting the syntax of my code also vexed me but become integral in my learning process as I'm obligated to enhance my understanding of javascript syntax.
